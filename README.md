Rewrite all the languages in Rust x3

# FAQ
## What is this?

This is a project dedicated to rewriting every language in Rust. The idea is to eventually use the Rust code to ~~create a mobile learning application better than Luodingo~~ make it more fun to learn the languages by reading them in Rust while wearing programming socks :3

## Will this make me native in my TL?

I cannot guarantee that, but it will make you native in Rust, which has good native shocking potential.

## How can I contribute?

Feel free to send pull requests.
